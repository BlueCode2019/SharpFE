# SharpFE

SharpFE is an open source finite element solver for .Net.  It is designed to be lightweight and relatively easy to use alongside or within other pieces of software or scripts.

The primary use case is the analysis of relatively small geometric models within parametric modelling tools (such as Grasshopper for McNeel's Rhino), with the aim to return results in near real-time as the parameters are adjusted.

The code base and architecture is designed to be modular so that it is tailorable and expandable.  Where trade-offs in the design have had to be made, the design has chosen software engineering principles (DRY, Separation of Concerns etc.) and understandable code over speed.

SharpFE is currently in an Alpha state of development and is therefore unstable and unverified.
