# SharpFE

SharpFE is an open source finite element solver for .Net.  It is designed to be lightweight, API based, relatively fast for relatively small models.

It is targeted at the analysis of small models in parametric modelling tools, with the aim to return results in near real-time as the parameters are adjusted.

SharpFE is currently in an Alpha state of development and is therefore unstable and unverified.
